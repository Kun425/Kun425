title: "Wall Shear Stress Analysis for Blood Vessel's Inner Surface"
excerpt: "To analyze the WSS in complex fluids with cell suspensions, numerical simulations of blood flows in simple straight channels were conducted, where the fluid-solid interactions were simulated by immersed boundary-lattice Boltzmann method. The spatiotemporal dynamics of WSS were analyzed using dynamic mode decomposition (DMD), which is a technique that can extract the low-rank spatiotemporal features from complex fluids.<br/><img src='/showcaseimages/stress_analysis.png'>"

        <p>In this project, the blood flow simulation is achieved by the coupling of Lammps and Palabos. The major goal is to investigate the dynamics of the inner vessel wall under the impact of the flowing red blood cells.
