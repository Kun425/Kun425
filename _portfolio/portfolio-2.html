title: "Wall Shear Stress Analysis for Blood Vessel's Inner Surface"
excerpt: "To analyze the WSS in complex fluids with cell suspensions, numerical simulations of blood flows in simple straight channels were conducted, where the fluid-solid interactions were simulated by immersed boundary-lattice Boltzmann method. The spatiotemporal dynamics of WSS were analyzed using dynamic mode decomposition (DMD), which is a technique that can extract the low-rank spatiotemporal features from complex fluids."
