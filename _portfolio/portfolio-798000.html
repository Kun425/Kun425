        <h2>Simulation and Workflow</h2>
        <p>The simulation of fluid-solid coupling is achieved by immersed boundary-lattice Boltzmann method based on the open source software Palabos, where a harmonic wave is applied to the fish body to achieve the motion of fish swimming. The simulation results are analyzed by dynamic mode decomposition to study the spatiotemporal dynamics of fish swimming.</p>

        <h3>Workflow:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>The fish mesh is reconstructed from point clouds generated by fitting functions for the fish body.</li>
            <li>Conduct grid independence study and validate the algorithm by benchmark cases such as flow passing oscillating and static spheres.</li>
            <li>Visualize simulation results and use Q-criterion to extract vortex structures for flow pattern investigation.</li>
            <li>Apply dynamic mode decomposition on the fluid data to reveal the hidden dynamics of fish swimming.</li>
