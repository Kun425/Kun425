        <p> In this study, the flow past a two-dimensional cylinder is adopted as the simulation case to investigate the capability of the neural network for the immersed boundary method. For the direct-forcing immersed boundary method, a dirac function is used for the velocity interpolation and force spreading with the information of neighbor points. However, this step can also be achieved by the machine learning model with a robust performance.
